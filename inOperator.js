// //The in operator checks if a property exists anywhere in the object or its prototype chain.

// const animal = {
//     name: "Dog"
// };

// console.log("name" in animal);      
// console.log("toString" in animal); 

// //this is the same example that i gave for hasOwnProperty but here it returns true for both because toString exists in its prototype
